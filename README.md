# IAS_horizon_scanning

This repository contains the code used to conduct a horizon scanning exercise for invasive alien species.
This exercise is conducted at the EU level, and aims to produce a list of the 100 species that are most likely to arrive, establish, spread and have an impact on native biodiversity or associated ecosystem services in the EU over the next 10 years.
